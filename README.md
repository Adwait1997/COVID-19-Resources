### This repository contains a curated list of resources for constructing mathematical models and doing analysis on COVID-19.

As you may know that the Corona Virus or Sars-Cov-2 is wrecking havoc on the face of Earth. It has challenged even the developed nations like the USA, UK, Italy, etc by overwhelming their health care facilities, collapsing their economy and puting lives of billions at risk. This is a small effort from ourside to design a system to analyse the situation and lessen the effect by studing virus' rapid growth.
